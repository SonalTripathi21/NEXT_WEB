# NEXT_WEB
I recently built a frontend project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, I focused on designing a clean and responsive layout using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. I also used JavaScript to make the website interactive — like handling button clicks, adding animations, and managing user input.

It was a great learning experience where I got to apply what I’ve learned about web development and improve my skills in writing clean, organized code. The project helped me understand how these three core technologies work together to build a functional and user-friendly website.
